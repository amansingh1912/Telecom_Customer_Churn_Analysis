## Overview:

* I got the dataset from one the data challenges organized on LinkedIn where the task is to analyze the customer churned in the Telecom Company specifically.
* There were several files in the dataset for analysis.

### Requirements and about the dataset:

#### About:

Churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

#### Requirements:
For the challenge, I was required to analyse the dataset and present findings in form of a report.

### Tools Used: MYSQL, Figma, Power BI, Logomakr.com

## Understanding and Analyzing the dataset:

Key questions or metrics I addressed during the analysis:
* Churn Status on various parameters.
* Overview of Total Telecom Company.

### Steps of analyzing data using MYSQL:
* Loading the given csv files/tables in MYSQL.
* Making extra column for Age Range to filter different age groups via SQL commands.
* Finding numerical results for "Churn Status" on various parameters with respect to the data using SQL queries.
* Now, after doing the required changes downloading files from MYSQL.

After loading the relevant tables in Power BI, we apply the following operations:

## Application of DAX measures:
During the process of making dashboard, I applied several DAX measures like AVERAGE, SUM to come up with numerical insights which are insightful to the end user.

## Visualization in Power BI:
### Theme and Color Palette:

* I went with the light theme for the dashboard and visualization is static and single-paged.
* Colors chosen: White, black and green shades.

### Visualization:

Here, I used Figma to create layout for static visualization page.

## Conclusion:

Overall, it was a good dataset to analyze and gave a good practice over SQL and visualization.
